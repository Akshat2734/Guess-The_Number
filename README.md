**Number Guessing Game with Difficulty Levels:**

This program is an interactive number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy and hard.

**Features:**

1. **Welcome Message:** The game starts with a welcoming message informing the player about the rules and asking them to choose a difficulty level (easy or hard).

2. **Random Number Generation:** A random number between 1 and 100 is generated using Python's `random.randint()` function. This number serves as the target for the player to guess.

3. **Difficulty Levels:** The player can choose between easy and hard modes. In easy mode, the player has 10 attempts to guess the number, while in hard mode, they have only 5 attempts.

4. **Game Loop:** The core of the game is a loop where the player is prompted to enter their guess. After each guess, the program provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player's remaining attempts are also displayed.

5. **Ending the Game:** The game continues until the player guesses the correct number within the specified number of attempts or exhausts all their attempts. Once the game ends, the program informs the player whether they won or lost.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this program is to provide an entertaining and interactive game experience for players of all ages. By offering two difficulty levels, the game caters to players with varying skill levels and provides a challenge that can be adjusted based on the player's preference.
